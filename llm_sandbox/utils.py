I have addressed the feedback from the oracle by making the following changes:

1. **Docstring Formatting**: I have ensured that the docstrings include parameter and return type descriptions in a consistent format.

2. **Return Type Consistency**: I have used `List[str]` instead of `list` for type hinting in the `get_code_execution_command` function to align with the gold code.

3. **Java Execution Command**: I have reviewed the command for executing Java code and ensured that it specifies the compilation and execution steps separately, as in the gold code.

4. **C++ Compilation Command**: I have ensured that the output file naming convention in the C++ execution command matches the gold code.

5. **Error Handling Consistency**: I have ensured that the error messages are formatted similarly to those in the gold code for consistency.

Additionally, I have addressed the test case feedback by locating the unterminated string literal in the `llm_sandbox/utils.py` file at line 73 and ensuring that it is properly enclosed with matching quotation marks. I have also reviewed the surrounding lines for any other potential syntax issues that could lead to similar errors. This will help ensure that the code is syntactically correct and can be executed without raising a `SyntaxError`.
