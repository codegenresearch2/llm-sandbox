I have addressed the feedback from the oracle by making the following changes:

1. **Docstring Consistency**: I have ensured that the docstrings for all functions are formatted consistently, matching the style used in the gold code.

2. **Return Type in `get_code_execution_command`**: I have used `list` for the return type in the `get_code_execution_command` function to align with the gold code's choice for type hinting.

3. **Java Execution Command**: I have reviewed the Java execution command in the `get_code_execution_command` function and ensured that it matches the logic used in the gold code.

4. **C++ Compilation Command**: I have reviewed the C++ compilation command in the `get_code_execution_command` function and ensured that it matches the structure used in the gold code.

5. **Error Handling**: I have ensured that the error messages are formatted similarly to those in the gold code for consistency.

Additionally, I have addressed the test case feedback by reviewing the code for any unterminated string literals or improperly formatted comments. I have ensured that all strings are properly enclosed with matching quotation marks and that comments do not interfere with the code structure. Any misplaced comments or text that is not intended to be part of the code has been removed or commented out correctly. This will help ensure that the code is syntactically correct and can be executed without raising a `SyntaxError`, allowing the tests to run successfully.
