I have addressed the feedback from the oracle by making the following changes:

1. **Docstring Formatting**: I have ensured that the docstrings for all functions are formatted consistently, including a brief description, parameter annotations, and return type annotations.

2. **Return Type Consistency**: I have used `List[str]` from the `typing` module for the return type in the `get_code_execution_command` function to enhance clarity and consistency with the gold code.

3. **Java Execution Command**: I have reviewed the Java execution command in the `get_code_execution_command` function and ensured that it matches the structure used in the gold code.

4. **Error Handling Messages**: I have ensured that the error messages raised in exceptions are formatted similarly to those in the gold code.

5. **Code Structure and Readability**: I have paid attention to the overall structure and readability of the code. I have ensured that the indentation, spacing, and line breaks are consistent with the gold code to enhance clarity.

Additionally, I have addressed the test case feedback by reviewing the code for any unterminated string literals or improperly formatted comments. I have ensured that all strings are properly enclosed with matching quotation marks and that comments do not interfere with the code structure. Any misplaced comments or text that is not intended to be part of the code has been removed or commented out correctly. This will help ensure that the code is syntactically correct and can be executed without raising a `SyntaxError`, allowing the tests to run successfully.
